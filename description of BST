A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a data structure in computer science that facilitates fast lookup, addition, and deletion operations. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of BSTs in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA):

Key Characteristics of a BST
Node Structure: Each node contains:

A value.
A reference to the left child node.
A reference to the right child node.
Ordering Property: For any node N:

All values in the left subtree are less than the value in N.
All values in the right subtree are greater than the value in N.
